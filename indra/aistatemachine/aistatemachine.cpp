//==================================================================
// Overview

// A AIStateMachine is a base class that allows derived classes to
// go through asynchronous states, while the code still appears to
// be more or less sequential.
//
// These state machine objects can be reused to build more complex
// objects.
//
// It is important to note that each state has a duality: the object
// can have a state that will cause a corresponding function to be
// called; and often that function will end with changing the state
// again, to signal that it was handled. It is easy to confuse the
// function of a state with the state at the end of the function.
// For example, the state "initialize" could cause the member
// function 'init()' to be called, and at the end one would be
// inclined to set the state to "initialized". However, this is the
// wrong approach: the correct use of state names does reflect the
// functions that will be called, never the function that just was
// called.
//
// Each (derived) class goes through a series of states as follows:
//
//   Creation
//       |
//       v
//     (idle) <----.   		Idle until run() is called.
//       |         |
//   Initialize    |		Calls initialize_impl().
//       |         |
//       | (idle)  |		Idle until cont() or advance_state() is called.
//       |  |  ^   |
//       v  v  |   |
//   .-----------. |
//   | Multiplex | |		Call multiplex_impl() until idle(), abort() or finish() is called.
//   '-----------' |
//    |    |       |
//    v    |       |
//  Abort  |       |		Calls abort_impl().
//    |    |       |
//    v    v       |
//    Finish       |		Calls finish_impl(), which may call run().
//    |    |       |
//    |    v       |
//    | Callback   |        which may call kill() and/or run().
//    |  |   |     |
//    |  |   `-----'
//    v  v
//  Killed					Delete the statemachine (all statemachines must be allocated with new).
//
// Each state causes corresponding code to be called.
// Finish cleans up whatever is done by Initialize.
// Abort should clean up additional things done while running.
//
// The running state is entered by calling run().
//
// While the base class is in the bs_multiplex state, it is the derived class
// that goes through different states. The state variable of the derived
// class is only valid while the base class is in the bs_multiplex state.
//
// A derived class can exit the bs_multiplex state by calling one of two methods:
// abort() in case of failure, or finish() in case of success.
// Respectively these set the state to bs_abort and bs_finish.
//
// The methods of the derived class call set_state() to change their
// own state within the bs_multiplex state, or by calling either abort()
// or finish().
//
// Restarting a finished state machine can be done by calling run(),
// which will cause a re-initialize. The default is to destruct the
// state machine once the last LLPointer to it is deleted.
//


//==================================================================
// Declaration

// Every state machine is (indirectly) derived from AIStateMachine.
// For example:

#ifdef EXAMPLE_CODE	// undefined

class HelloWorld : public AIStateMachine {
  protected:
	// The base class of this state machine.
	typedef AIStateMachine direct_base_type;

	// The different states of the state machine.
	enum hello_world_state_type {
	  HelloWorld_start = direct_base_type::max_state,
	  HelloWorld_done,
	};
  public:
	static state_type const max_state = HelloWorld_done + 1;	// One beyond the largest state.

  public:
	// The derived class must have a default constructor.
	HelloWorld();

  protected:
	// The destructor must be protected.
	/*virtual*/ ~HelloWorld();

  protected:
	// The following virtual functions must be implemented:

	// Handle initializing the object.
	/*virtual*/ void initialize_impl(void);

	// Handle mRunState.
	/*virtual*/ void multiplex_impl(state_type run_state);

	// Handle aborting from current bs_multiplex state (the default AIStateMachine::abort_impl() does nothing).
	/*virtual*/ void abort_impl(void);

	// Handle cleaning up from initialization (or post abort) state (the default AIStateMachine::finish_impl() does nothing).
	/*virtual*/ void finish_impl(void);

	// Return human readable string for run_state.
	/*virtual*/ char const* state_str_impl(state_type run_state) const;
};

// In the .cpp file:

char const* HelloWorld::state_str_impl(state_type run_state) const
{
  switch(run_state)
  {
	// A complete listing of hello_world_state_type.
	AI_CASE_RETURN(HelloWorld_start);
	AI_CASE_RETURN(HelloWorld_done);
  }
#if directly_derived_from_AIStateMachine
  llassert(false);
  return "UNKNOWN STATE";
#else
  llassert(run_state < direct_base_type::max_state);
  return direct_base_type::state_str_impl(run_state);
#endif
}

#endif // EXAMPLE_CODE


//==================================================================
// Life cycle: creation, initialization, running and destruction

// Any thread may create a state machine object, initialize it by calling
// it's initializing member function and call one of the 'run' methods,
// which might or might not immediately start to execute the state machine.

#ifdef EXAMPLE_CODE
  HelloWorld* hello_world = new HelloWorld;
  hello_world->init(...);					// A custom initialization function.
  hello_world->run(...);					// One of the run() functions.
  // hello_world might be destructed here.
  // You can avoid possible destruction by using an LLPointer<HelloWorld>
  // instead of HelloWorld*.
#endif // EXAMPLE_CODE

// The call to run() causes a call to initialize_impl(), which MUST call
//   set_state() at least once (only the last call is used).
// Upon return from initialize_impl(), multiplex_impl() will be called
//   with that state.
// multiplex_impl() may never reentrant (cause itself to be called).
// multiplex_impl() should end by callling either one of:
//   idle(), yield*(), finish() [or abort()].
// Leaving multiplex_impl() without calling any of those might result in an
//   immediate reentry, which could lead to 100% CPU usage unless the state
//   is changed with set_state().
// If multiplex_impl() calls finish() then finish_impl() will be called [if it
//   calls abort() then abort_impl() will called, followed by finish_impl()].
// Upon return from multiplex_impl(), and if finish() [or abort()] was called,
//   the call back passed to run() will be called.
// Upon return from the call back, the state machine object might be destructed
//   (see below).
// If idle() was called, and the state was (still) current_state,
//   then multiplex_impl() will not be called again until the state is
//   advanced, or cont() is called.
//
// If the call back function does not call run(), then the state machine is
//   deleted when the last LLPointer<> reference is deleted.
// If kill() is called after run() was called, then the call to run() is ignored.


//==================================================================
// Aborting

// If abort() is called before initialize_impl() is entered, then the state
//   machine is destructed after the last LLPointer<> reference to it is
//   deleted (if any). Note that this is only possible when a child state
//   machine is aborted before the parent even runs.
//
// If abort() is called inside its initialize_impl() that initialize_impl()
//   should return immediately after.
// if idle(), abort() or finish() are called inside its multiplex_impl() then
//   that multiplex_impl() should return immediately after.
//


//==================================================================
// Thread safety

// Only one thread can "run" a state machine at a time; can call 'multiplex_impl'.
//
// Only from inside multiplex_impl (set_state also from initialize_impl), any of the
// following functions can be called:
//
// - set_state(new_state)		--> Force the state to new_state. This voids any previous call to set_state() or idle().
// - idle()						--> If there was no call to advance_state() since the last call to set_state(current_state))
//                                  then go idle (do nothing until cont() or advance_state() is called). If the current
//                                  state is not current_state,	then multiplex_impl shall be reentered immediately upon return.
// - finish()					--> Disables any scheduled runs.
// 								--> finish_impl		--> [optional] kill()
// 								--> call back
// 								--> [optional] delete
// 								--> [optional] reset, upon return from multiplex_impl, call initialize_impl and start again at the top of multiplex.
// - yield([engine])			--> give CPU to other state machines before running again, run next from a state machine engine.
// 									If no engine is passed, the state machine will run in it's default engine (as set during construction).
// - yield_frame()/yield_ms()	--> yield(&gMainThreadEngine)
//
// the following function may be called from multiplex_impl() of any state machine (and thus by any thread):
//
// - abort()					--> abort_impl
// 								--> finish()
//
// while the following functions may be called from anywhere (and any thread):
//
// - cont()						--> schedules a run if there was no call to set_state() or advance_state() since the last call to idle().
// - advance_state(new_state)	--> sets the state to new_state, if the new_state > current_state, and schedules a run (and voids the last call to idle()).
//
// In the above "scheduling a run" means calling multiplex_impl(), but the same holds for any *_impl()
// and the call back: Whenever one of those have to be called, thread_safe_impl() is called to
// determine if the current state machine allows that function to be called by the current thread,
// and if not - by which thread it should be called then (either main thread, or a special state machine
// thread). If thread switching is necessary, the call is literally scheduled in a queue of one
// of those two, otherwise it is run immediately.
//
// However, since only one thread at a time may be calling any *_impl function (except thread_safe_impl())
// or the call back function, it is possible that at the moment scheduling is necessary another thread
// is already running one of those functions. In that case thread_safe_impl() does not consider the
// current thread, but rather the running thread and does not do any scheduling if the running thread
// is ok, rather marks the need to continue running which should be picked up upon return from
// whatever the running thread is calling.
