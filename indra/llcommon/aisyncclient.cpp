/*
 * AISyncClient : the base class of a client object (LLMotion) that needs to be informed
 * of the state of other such objects and/or to poll a server object about the state of
 * other such objects, in order to be and stay synchronized with those other objects.
 * In the case of an LLMotion (animation), all clients would be started and stopped at
 * the same time, as long as they are part of the same synchronization group (AISyncServer).
 *
 * AISyncKey: object that determines what synchronization group a client belongs to.
 * When a new client is created, a new AISyncKey is created too, using information from
 * the client, the current frame number and the current frame time. If two AISyncKey
 * compare equal, using operator==(AISyncKey const& key1, AISyncKey const& key2),
 * then the clients that created them need to be synchronized.
 *
 * AISyncServer: object that represents a group of clients that need to be synchronized:
 * it's a wrapper around a std::list<AISyncClientData> with pointers to all the clients
 * that need to be synchronized. It also stores the AISyncKey of the first (oldest) client
 * that was added. Clients with keys that compare equal to that will be added.
 * If a client is added with a synckeytype_t that is larger then it always replaces
 * the existing key however.
 *
 * AISyncServerMap: A wrapper around std::list<boost::intrusive_ptr<AISyncServer> >
 * that stores pointers to all currently existing AISyncServer objects. New entries
 * are added at the end, so the oldest key is at the front.
 *
 * AISyncServerMap  list + - - - - - - + - - - - - - + ...		The AISyncServerMap is
 *                       |             |             |			a list with refcounted
 *                       V             V             V			pointers to AISyncServers.
 * AISyncClient	+--> AISyncServer
 *     |        <--- list     key ---> AISyncKey				Each AISyncServer is a
 * DerivedClient      .											list of normal pointers
 *                    .											AISyncClients and one
 *              <---  .											pointer to a AISyncKey.
 *              												Each AISyncClient is the
 *              												base class of a DerivedClient
 *              												and pointers back to the
 *              												server with a refcounted
 *              												pointer.
 *
 * A new client is passed to the AISyncServerMap to be stored in a new or existing AISyncServer
 * object, using the key that the client produces. A boost::intrusive_ptr<AISyncServer> member
 * of the client is set to point to this server.
 *
 * The lifetime of the server objects is determined by the intrusive_ptr objects that
 * point to it: all the clients (which have an externally determined lifetime) and one
 * pointer in the AISyncServerMap. However, regularly a check is done on all servers in
 * the list to find expired servers: objects with keys older than two frames and older
 * than 0.1 seconds; if such a server is found and it has zero or one client, then the
 * client is unregistered and the pointer (and thus the server) removed from the
 * AISyncServerMap. If it has two or more clients then the entry is kept until both
 * clients are removed, which therefore can only be detected in intrusive_ptr_release
 * which only has access to the server object. The server then is removed from the list
 * by searching through it for the pointer to the server.
