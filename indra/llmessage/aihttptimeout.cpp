  // seconds.
  //
  // We do this as follows: we create low_speed_time (in seconds) buckets and fill them with the number
  // of bytes received during that second. We also keep track of the sum of all bytes received between 'now'
  // and 'llmax(starttime, now - low_speed_time)'. Then if that period reaches at least low_speed_time
  // seconds (when now >= starttime + low_speed_time) and the transfer rate (sum / low_speed_time) is
  // less than low_speed_limit, we abort.
