 *   Renamed everything "host" to "service" and use "hostname:port" as key

//
// url			= sheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
// hier-part	= "//" authority path-abempty
// authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
// path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
//
// That is, a hier-part of the form '/ path-absolute', '/ path-rootless' or
// '/ path-empty' is NOT allowed here. This should be safe because we only
// call this function for curl access, any file access would use APR.
//
// However, as a special exception, this function allows:
//
// url			= authority path-abempty
//
// without the 'sheme ":" "//"' parts.
//
// As follows from the ABNF (see RFC, Appendix A):
// - authority is either terminated by a '/' or by the end of the string because
//   neither userinfo, host nor port may contain a '/'.
// - userinfo does not contain a '@', and if it exists, is always terminated by a '@'.
// - port does not contain a ':', and if it exists is always prepended by a ':'.
//
// This function also needs to deal with full paths, in which case it should return
// an empty string.
//
// Full paths can have the form: "/something..."
//                           or  "C:\something..."
//               and maybe even  "C:/something..."
//
// The first form leads to an empty string being returned because the '/' signals the
// end of the authority and we'll return immediately.
// The second one will abort when hitting the backslash because that is an illegal
// character in an url (before the first '/' anyway).
// The third will abort because "C:" would be the hostname and a colon in the hostname
// is not legal.
